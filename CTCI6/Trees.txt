Trees vs Binary Tree 

	In Tree, node can have more than 2 children
	In Binary Tree, node has up to 2 children not more than two.
	
Binary Tree vs Binary Search Tree

	Binary search tree is a binary tree in which every node fits a specific ordering:
	all left nodes <= n < all right nodes
	
Balanced vs Unbalanced
	
	Balanced tree doesn't mean that the left and right subtrees are exactly the same. "Balanced" mean something like
	"not terribly imbalanced". It's balance enough to ensure O(logn) time for insert and search. Red-black and AVL tree is 
	example of balance tree.

Complete Binary Tree
	
	complete binary tree is binary tree in which every level of tree is full filled, except last level. To extend that the last
	level is filled, it is filled left to right.
	
Example:

	(Not complete binary tree because left side of 20 is empty)
		10
		/\
	   5  20
	  /\   \
	 3  7   30
	 
	(A complete binary tree: Although node 20 doesn't have right node)
		10
		/ \
	   5   20
	  /\   /
	 3  7 15
	 
Full Binary Trees

	It is a binary tree in which every node has either zero or two children. No node have one child.
	
Perfect Binary Trees

	It is a combination of Complete and Full Binary tree.
